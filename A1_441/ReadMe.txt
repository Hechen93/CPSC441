CPSC 441 F2020, Assignment 1

Purpose: This document describes how to run Assignment 1's Proxy server to change text and images to the robot spoof images.

Steps:
    1) Set up Google Chrome Browser session in incognito mode. Do not go to the http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sina.keshvadi1/441/web/index.html yet.
    2) Set up Chrome Proxy settings using: 
                    Proxy IP Address: 136.159.5.25
                    Port Number: 8484
    3) Apply Proxy changes to Chrome browser. Next navigate to the http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sina.keshvadi1/441/web/index.html site.
    4) Navigating through the site links should display the requisite text and image changes as described by the Assignment outline.
    5) To turn off proxy, open Chrome Proxy settings again under Chrome Settings > Advanced > System and uncheck the proxy setting. This will return navigation through the
    http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sina.keshvadi1/441/web/index.html back to normal. This means it will display normal NBA images.
